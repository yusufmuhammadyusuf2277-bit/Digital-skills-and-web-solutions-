  <p>
    A zero-day exploit targets a software vulnerability unknown to the vendor. Since no patch exists, attackers can exploit it immediately.
  </p>

  <div class="example">
    <strong>Example:</strong><br>
    A new bug in a popular browser allows remote code execution. Hackers exploit it before a fix is released.
  </div>

  <p>
    Defense includes monitoring suspicious activity, applying virtual patches, and using intrusion detection systems.
  </p>

  <div class="exercise">
